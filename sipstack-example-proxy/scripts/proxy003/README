This directory contains the necesssary SIPp scripts to run the sipstack.io 
Simple Proxy 003 example. The difference between exmple 003 and the earlier
ones is that 003 is able to accept and send across both udp and tcp and is
triggered on the transport parameter in the request-uri. Hence, there are
two UAC scenario files, one for UDP and one for TCP, and when used, it will
make the Simple Proxy to choose that transport for the "proxied" request.

Run like so:

Start the two UAS:s, one that listens to UDP and one on TCP. Both 
listens to port 5080 on localhost but can of course be changed.

./uas.sh
./uas_tcp.sh

Then start the SIPp UAC instances:
./uac.sh
./uac_udp.sh
./uac_tcp.sh

Where the first one will listen to UDP and ask the proxied hop to
the UAS to be over UDP.

The next two ones will both listen to TCP, hence, they will use
TCP to talk to the Simple Proxy 003 sample app but then ask
to have the leg from Simple Proxy to the UAS to be over
UDP and TCP respectively.
