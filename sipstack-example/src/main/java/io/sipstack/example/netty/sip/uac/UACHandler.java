     * Generating an ACK to a 2xx response is the same as any other subsequent request. However, a
     * subsequent request is generated in the context of what is known as a Dialog and since we
     * currently are completely stateless, this is not necessarily an easy thing to achieve but for
     * now we will ignore many of the details.
     * 
     * The general idea is this though:
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li>The sub-sequent request is going to be sent to where ever the Contact header of the
     * response is pointing to. This is known as the remote-target.</li>
     * <li>CSeq is incremented by one EXCEPT for ACK's, which will have the same sequence number as
     * what it is "ack:ing". The method of the CSeq is "ACK" though.</li>
     * <li>Call-ID has to be the same</li>
     * <li>The remote and local tags has to be correctly preserved on the To- and From-headers</li>
     * <li></li>
     * <li></li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @param response
